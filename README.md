## Contributing

If you're looking for a starter development task to get your feet wet with our codebase, any of our Issues tagged [help wanted](https://github.com/openfresno/openfresno.org/issues) might be a good fit.

Some of the other Issues are larger and require some deeper design or architectural work; if one of those catches your eye, you'll probably want to talk with us for some more context and background. Either comment on the Issue or — even better — catch up with us at one of [Open Fresno's weekly Hack Nights](https://www.meetup.com/openfresno/).

This project is coded with, among other things:

- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/), an open-source React component library that implements Google's Material Design
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), a rendering library for JavaScript
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), a CSS preprocessor
